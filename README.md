Thanks for taking a look at my React portfolio site!

I am a front-end developer based in Australia looking to enter the industry in my first role.

This React site was built as part of a Javascript development course and it serves as my first React portfolio piece.

Feel free to have a look and any feedback you might have would be welcome.
